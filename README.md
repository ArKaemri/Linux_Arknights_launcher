### Quick info before core
1. If you have other option than Android Studio to run Arknights, skip this project, don't be a masochist
2. For this to run you need:
  - Requirements? (not sure if have any impact): Linux Mint (wilma) specifically, Android 14.0 (device version in Android Studio)
  - Requirements: regular color scheme (script works on color recognition, if you have color blind or custom color themes, it will most likely break), Android Studio, working Arknights (login once) (if getting 'out of storage' error when installing, "solution" is in 'Arknights Install' part), python, python-venv, pip, Linux, Nvidia GPU (if you have AMD try Waydroid instead), play on Arknights EN
3. Android emulators already finicky on Linux, playing Arknights on Linux using Android emulator is a total Karen, so even with all the setup it may not work, so no promises
4. This is not a good solution, just a crutches when nothing else works but you still want to play on PC (and don't want to dual boot), basically "best" out of the worst options
5. I will not discuss how to install Android Studio, adb or python
# Project Introduction
This project is a script that will open emulator, open Arknights, launch it when having 'data expired' problem and run MAA Assistant. You will need to adapt some values in script, for MAA to work correctly, and the MAA files themselves to customize tasks. The only option that worked for me to run Arknights on Linux PC with Nvidia GPU was Android Studio with device 14.0 version (android-34/google_apis/x86_64/), it works quite reliably (crashed maybe 4 times in 5 months of everyday login twice, never during stage or IS, only when in base/menu's) and has easy MAA integration, the only problem is 'data expired' problem, that makes you click 'recover resources' (in Arknights) every time you launch emulator (sometimes twice in a row, sometimes this error doesn't happen, to minimize chance of this happening, before closing emulator click 'power' button or press CTRL + P), so I decided to make work-around to "fix" this problem to just automate everything -> press shortcut, leave and have Arknights to launch itself and do base automation with MAA. This project will go through: configuring Android emulator (needs same size while launching arknights, when you already logged in resizing is fine, it works when emulator behind other windows + disabling on screen buttons so they won't appear when dragging operators gor general QoL), installing Arknights (with 'out of storage' error, even when you have 60GB left free), configuring MAA, binding to shortcut. 
# Android Setup
1. In Android Studio open 'Virtual Device Manager' (click on 3-dot in top right)
2. Click on '+' (Create Virtual Device), then press 'New Hardware Profile...'
3. Create profile as shown in 'device.png': Name - Arknights (if you choose different, you'll need to change it in the script), Type - Phone, Screen size - 5 inch, Resolution - 1920x1080, Ram - 8GB (may try less), Default skin - None, Only keep selected - Portrait/Landscape/Accelerometer/Gyroscope (for rotating device)
4. Create device with: API - 'API 34 "UpsideDownCake"; Android 14.0' (can try different, but this the only one that worked for me), Services - 'Google APIs', System Image - 'Google APIs Intel x86_64 Atom System Image', Internal storage - 64GB (may try less, adding more doesn't fix the problem, so 32GB should work), Expanded storage - dosen't change anything (so can choose None or leave 0.5GB), CPU cores - 4 or less, Ram - 8GB or less, VM heap size - 4GB or less, everything else just leave as it is
5. Launch emulator, go to System -> Navigation mode -> select '3-button navigation' (this with mainKeys=yes option will disable on screen buttons, so they won't appear when dragging operators from deployment zone on the map)
6. Install Arknights
7. Open the 'config.ini' file at ~/.android/avd/Arknights.avd/ (or your name instead of Arknights) and check the values, for reference you can look at 'config.ini' that I use, the only parts you care about are: hw.lcd.height=1080, hw.lcd.width=1920, hw.mainKeys=yes
8. Save changes in config file, close the emulator and relaunch
# Arknights Install
1. Open default browser on emulator, install F-Droid, from it install Aurora Store, login as anonymous and search Arknights (if can't find/non-compatible, get another android version)
2. Then launch Arknights and let it to install the packages (it may close once, just reopen, if it keeps closing at same point, get another android version)
3. Once it will install everything and start decompressing files, you will get error 'ran out of storage', even when you have plenty left, just click ok and let it install resources (it will go back to about 98%)
4. Once it starts to decompress resources, click 'clear cache', then 'recover resources'
5. After resources recovered, more packages will be installed (less than start) OR starts decompressing again, wait until it throws error, click ok and repeat step 3, but recover resources slightly before the error
6. Continue until getting login screen (need to repeat about 2-4 times)
7. **IMPORTANT** if you get error on login page, press ok, if after yellow bar loads, it dissapears and bottom bar is just black, without loading further, **DO NOT RECOVER RESOURCES**, close Arknights and reopen, then recover resources, otherwise you will get unresponsive Arknights before any loading that doesn't react to clicks, the only option now is to wipe data from Arknights and install from start
- General idea - you want to 'recover resources' slightly before the storage error appears each time, increasing incrementally until there is no higher % to reach
# MAA Setup
1. Get MAA-cli executable from https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/maa-cli (get the release zip and extract maa file)
2. Give execution rights to the file (in folder where file is, in terminal run 'chmod +x ./maa)
3. Setup maa, instruction is at https://docs.maa.plus/en-us/manual/cli/usage.html, from what I remember you just need run in terminal 'maa install' and 'maa update' (or ./maa install if it doesn't work), setup file will be done manually
4. Open ~/.config/maa/profiles/default.json (create it, unless it already exist) and fill the info with example file (default.json) (check 'device' name, it shows on top bar of emulator when launched)
5. Create the task files in ~/.config/maa/tasks/, name anything you want with extension .toml (can use JSON, but then you need to rewrite them) ('name' without .toml is used to launch the file with maa)
6. Fill in the .toml files, you can reuse the 'daily.toml' and 'recruit.toml' files I use, to customize files go to https://docs.maa.plus/en-us/protocol/integration.html#list-of-task-types
- Recruit file just does 3 recruits, using 7:40 to no guaranteed >3-stars and stops for robots/6-stars
- Daily file does same recruitment, visits friends, collect all base resources and spend drones on Combat Records, then gets credits from daily shop (it doesn't auto assigns operators to dormitories/facilities, doesn't touch clues and doesn't shop/fight, I prefer to do them manually, how to use those options just use url with tasks, but facility assign doesn't use presets)
# Bind Shortcut
Now when everything configured (have MAA .toml files, MAA executable, android emulator, Arknights launch atleast once):
1. Get the script and code from repo (pull repo or create .sh/.py/.txt files and copy-paste the content)
2. Give the autority to run the script (in folder where file is, in terminal run 'chmod +x ./auto_arknights.sh)
3. Using 'requirements.txt' create virtual environment, in terminal write 'python3 -m venv .venv', activate it 'source .venv/bin/activate', install libraries 'pip install -r requirements.txt', close it 'deactivate'
4. In 'auto_arknights.sh' change MAA_PATH to the path of 'maa' executable to where you put it, ANDROID_NAME to your android emulator name (if used the same as mine, skip the name change) and PYTHON_FILE_PATH python code path (.venv should be in same path as python code)
5. Go to Menu -> System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Custom Shortcuts -> Add custom shortcut -> put in name, choose shortcut keys and give path to the './auto_arknights.sh'
- For example -> my .sh and .py in ~/Scripts/arknights/ and in ~/.config/maa/tasks/ I have file 'daily.toml' so shortcut will be: command - gnome-terminal -- bash -c "$HOME/Scripts/arknights/auto_arknights.sh daily", keys - CTRL+Super+1
